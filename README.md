#Project 1: Diabetes Prediction: Project Overview
* In this project, we aim to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures. We use a dataset that includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.
* Data Exploration: We started by exploring the data using Python. We analyzed the distributions of the features and the relationships between them. This step helped us understand the data better and informed our subsequent steps.
* Data Preprocessing: We preprocessed the data by handling missing values and scaling the features. This step is crucial as it can significantly impact the performance of the machine learning models.
* Model Training and Evaluation: We trained and evaluated several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. We calculated several metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to evaluate the performance of the models.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: We improved the performance of the Random Forest model by tuning its hyperparameters using grid search. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step as it can help us find the most optimal parameters for our model, thus improving its performance.
